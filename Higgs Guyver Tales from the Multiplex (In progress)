Higgs Guyver Tales from the Multiplex

“When lonely tell your brain to make a subset of thoughts to hang out with you. 
Any original improvisation can be misjudged as cheating, 
analogous to how advanced science looks like magic. 
As an identity living in history is easily achieved, 
through meaningful acts & thoughts"

A feeling of spiritual desolation was getting stronger by the minute. 
- Am I dying here?
A robotic voice from the b-chip resonates:
- It may be due to slow angular momentum, heavy compounds dissolved in O2, 
	and finally sir, your tendency to smoke tobacco, which produce acrylamide.
	It should really not be a combination for your survival right now.
- Options? Doesn’t seem to be any, and I feel stuck again in here.
- Sleeping in the forest with your nicotine, glycerine and propyl glycol vaporizer could be an alternative. 
	It is quite cold, which could lead to a state of hypothermia and desolation. 
- How is that a good idea?
- A guess based on hour hormonal/pheromone balance and socio-economic status. 
A prediction from the surrounding globe displays a curve varying from 0-5℃ throughout the week ahead. 
- It doesn’t seem that bad, and besides I miss the outside. This new unknown will be our new friend!
- Its been long since I haven’t had any relevant will to even start really living again
	but what do we do with the cold?
- Layers of cloth, route and ration planning. Enough calories, lipids and liquids to facilitate temperature and moist regulation.
	What is enough for each day?
- Body/temp index recommends 2750Kcal as an absolute minimum. 
- Thats it! lets warp there tomorrow or something.
- Notice that you already have become quite slow.
- How much time have I got left before my body rejects this situation?
- Your life expectancy staying here seems abysmally idle. 
	Enjoying this outdoor experience could become a potent sudo-remedy, for physiology optimization.
- I remember this last time! We had a blast didn't we?
- Temperature prediction adjusted to 10℃, due to a recent solar flare. 
- Dumb mathematics! Always wrong!
- Quantifying highly thermodynamical objects isn't completely achievable as long as their core remains unreachable.
- I was joking bruh!
- That you are, remember about surviving.
- You and your surviving. Always bugging me with what I need to do. Cannot wait to upgrade you to a funnier version of e-reality. 
	And even if all else fails, assuming you are right. There is always someone else ready to take my job right?
- Evolutionary progress is not that simple.
- Good joke.... Look at this space station. We are able to observe earth through a simple phrase, 
	and we haven't gotten a clue on how to achieve satisfaction through real progress.
- Chemically altering the brain, neural-frequencies, and subliminal messaging is usually working for most. 
	They are nonetheless diminishing concise voting or caring for scientific advancement
- Is that supposed to make me feel any better?
- Not really, just keeping you safe your way
- Yeah I remember now! Last time my mind went nuts about extrapolating and evaluating incomplete/bad datasets. 
	This dimension is just shit isn't it?
- As a reminder, this is your personal ER optimization. 
	Improving it will have an impact on this world and your socio-algo awareness.
- Buzzwords... Enhanced Reality, yeah enhancing that shit when many pointless opinions, advertisements and monotonic mediocrity is being forced in my face? 
	Rather just get some ethyl-alcohols and forget
- Tampering with your neurochemistry. Beware some methodology is advised.
- Sure
- GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter reduces synaptic responsibilities, ending some brain cells, an unreliable treatment for your condition.
- I tell you Im only tilting it a bit or a few octets hehe.
- Your symbiotic call from the forest planet seems more quintessential.
- Worries...

Echoes from inside two poles of a dome shaped room, a few parsec away:
- They call it SETI a signal quite strong, interfering with our communications.
- Humans and their silly attempt to reach out again!
- Are those species really broadcasting this?
- Love for their cultural history?
- As they keep destroying each others so called culture for that same love.
- Technically many consider other humans as ineligible cultural groups.
- We already discussed this, there is no sign of intelligence on earth. 
- I wonder how our agent is doing down there
- He must be bored!

Earth, Amazonia, inside space caps. 888. The transponder jammed.
- Where did we land? And why is there still no signal yet?
AI from the space/time drifter responds:
- Geo-analysis from entry shows another new call to any distant species.
- This primitive ritual of calling out again?
- Cross-ref points at data with 76% similarities to the old SETI program
- Q-thrusters, higher spectrometry and still reaching out?
- Humans are known to remain very traditional due to their neurochemistry.
- This type of call is asking for planetary resource and biomass exploitation
- Our fleet acts as protection for now, and might not last long. 
- Well they have evolved, now sending stronger signals. Back to the mission!
- Shutdown transmission and promote an understanding of our protocols
- Taking down their line seems simple, the rest will be very laborious.

Back in the station, alcohol was turning into more acetic conditions, and the mind of 
This human individual was degrading to a state of utter pessimistic skepticism.
- Bud, I am ready! Send me anywhere...
- Teleporting you to the green planet.

The ocean, green forests and higher oxygen levels. Arguably be a remedy in itself.
- Fascinating landscape! I almost already feel ready to focus on the calculus assignment. 
- The sky seems clear, although trace of exotic matter nearby.
A levitating extraterrestrial appears and tells the person:
- Human! I need your cooperation!
- No way! I almost thought that I had seen everything now this
- There is no time, I need you to log in your national account
- Wow there, Always knew scams was elaborated but this is good!
- I knew it, now you think that I am a scam! This is Hopeless
- Well even if I did, what would you have me do in there?
- I have a document that needs to be transmitted to a certain amount of people.
A large file is appearing
- What makes you think that they will read this?
- Those who won’t reply will simply have a physical mail, then a visit.
- What is it about?
- 4287 sides standard A4 about our multidimensional space-time civ-map
- They will also think that this is a good scam, lets go for it! 
- You seem to believe in certain things through very atypical ways
- Don't be like my brain transplant its telling me that a lot
- To communicate securely your civ must be transmit through secured q-layers
- Seems important, yet why not telling other lifeforms that we are alive in here?
- We have been observing you, you are not handling optimally your resources
- Yeah, sure blame me for that!
- I am not.
- Then?
- Your species face enormous danger broadcasting your loc!
- You mean some species will feel the need of re-appropriating resources?
- Certainly so, lack of high entropic management is a good pretext.
- How much time do we have approximatively?
- Would you let me send those documents?
- And why haven’t you hacked my interface already mr. superior being?
- It would leave a trace, and be a disagreement of the multiversal-civ sop.
- No way! Is there actually such a thing?

Back at the spherical stationary object the dialogue starts again:
- Most of our signals are working again! Who helped him?
- Quite the interesting type, I wonder where he found him.
- If the planet reach s-8 let us experiment on him, along with some others
- Hold it, we are just supposed to observe for now and carry s-1 standards
- You assume they have a standing chance?
- Predictively so I presume
- What is it in there for us?
- The answer is as little as the cost/effective ratio of their planetary yield.
- The fact that they were able to block our signals is...
- They are not the first species doing so.
- I know. Subordinates telling us that our ancestors actually did the same

To be continued.
